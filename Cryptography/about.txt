In today's digital era, data has become a fundamental asset. Transformative technologies including Big Data, Smart Cities, Cloud Computing, Social Networking, and the Internet of Things are being deployed worldwide to enhance quality of life, particularly as we manage increasingly sensitive information online.

In our interconnected society, unauthorized access to sensitive data can have severe repercussions, including data corruption, confidentiality breaches, and privacy violations. Consequently, it is vital for organizations, businesses, and individuals to ensure robust protection of critical information, such as client records, banking details, account credentials, and personal documents.

Effective data protection requires implementing comprehensive security measures to prevent unauthorized access. These protective measures include cryptography, hashing algorithms, and digital signatures. Through these technologies, data across websites, networks, and databases can be secured effectively, both at rest and in transit.

Let us explore cryptography's role as a cornerstone of data security:
Cryptography is the science of protecting information and communications through codes, ensuring only intended recipients can access and process the data.

Cryptography provides four essential elements:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authenticity
- Non-repudiation

It applies comprehensively to both stored information (data at rest) and transmitted information (data in transit).

This section will guide you through the fundamentals of cryptographic systems using practical scenarios.
