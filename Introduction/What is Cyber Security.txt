Cyber Security: An Introduction
===============================

Cyber Security is a set of techniques used to protect systems, networks, and applications from attacks, damage, or unauthorized access originating from the internet.

Cyber attacks aim to:
- Access, change, or destroy sensitive information
- Extort money from users
- Interrupt normal business processes

With more devices than people, implementing effective Cyber Security measures is a major challenge today.

According to Forbes, IT security spending was expected to reach $170 billion by 2020.

Security Objectives (The CIA Triad)
-----------------------------------

Cyber Security is built on three pillars, known as the CIA triad:

1. **Confidentiality**
    - Ensures data remains private and confidential.
    - Prevents unauthorized viewing of information.

2. **Integrity**
    - Protects data from accidental or deliberate modification.

3. **Availability**
    - Ensures timely and reliable access to information.

These principles are also referred to as the DAD triad (Disclosure, Alteration, Denial).

Supporting Concepts: AAA Services
---------------------------------

To support the CIA triad, three more concepts are essential:

1. **Authentication**
    - Verifying an identity.

2. **Authorization**
    - Determining if a user can access a resource or function.

3. **Accounting (Non-repudiation)**
    - Auditing: Recording user activities.
    - Accounting: Reviewing logs to check for violations and ensure users are answerable for their actions.

Key Terms in Cyber Security
---------------------------

- **Asset:** Anything valuable to an organization or person (devices, networks, software, hardware).
- **Information Asset:** Data with economic value to the organization; may be confidential or part of its identity.
- **Vulnerability:** A flaw or weakness in security procedures, design, or controls that could lead to a breach (e.g., software bugs, hardware flaws, human errors).
- **Exploit:** Software or commands that take advantage of a vulnerability (e.g., viruses, malware, server flooding).
- **Threat:** Potential danger from exploiting a vulnerability (e.g., ransomware attack).
- **Threat Agent:** Individual or group capable of causing a threat (e.g., hackers).
- **Risk:** Likelihood of a threat agent exploiting a vulnerability, multiplied by the impact on the organization.
  - Risk = Likelihood × Impact

---

Attack Vectors
--------------

Attackers may use various paths (attack vectors) to harm a business. Each path represents a risk, which may be easy or hard to exploit and can have varying consequences.

---

Controls
--------

Controls are measures to mitigate risks and protect assets.
- Example: Applying the latest security patches can prevent attacks like WannaCry ransomware.

Common Myths vs. Reality
------------------------

**Myth 1:** Digital and physical security are separate.
- **Reality:** Physical devices are digitally connected; hackers can target physical infrastructure.

**Myth 2:** Cyber security is just an IT issue.
- **Reality:** All digitized data must be protected, wherever it resides.

**Myth 3:** Protecting yourself is enough.
- **Reality:** Third parties (vendors, subcontractors) can be threat vectors.

**Myth 4:** Going back to paper minimizes risk.
- **Reality:** Paper copies can be unlawfully copied or removed without detection.

**Myth 5:** Using antivirus software is enough.
- **Reality:** Hackers can bypass antivirus software; ransomware acts quickly.

**Myth 6:** Having a firewall means you’re safe.
- **Reality:** Firewalls restrict traffic, but authorized users inside the firewall can still pose threats.

**Conclusion:**  
Understanding what needs to be secured is the first step in effective Cyber Security.
