Cyber Security Myths vs. Reality

There are many myths about Cyber Security that differ greatly from the facts. Let's debunk some common misconceptions:

Myth 1: “Digital and physical security are separate systems.”
Reality: Automation and AI are connecting physical devices—biometric systems, CCTV cameras, smart watches—to digital networks. Hackers can target these, causing serious damage to physical resources.

Myth 2: “Cyber security is just an IT issue.”
Reality: Once data is digitized, it must be protected everywhere—whether in a data center or on an employee’s mobile phone.

Myth 3: “Protecting yourself is good enough.”
Reality: Organizations must monitor everything and everyone. Third parties—subcontractors, vendors, accounting firms—can be threat vectors.

Myth 4: “Going back to paper minimizes risk.”
Reality: Paper copies can be unlawfully copied or removed without detection.

Myth 5: “Using antivirus software is enough.”
Reality: Hackers can bypass antivirus software and hide attacks for months. With ransomware, damage can occur almost instantly.

Myth 6: “We have a firewall. We’re in good shape.”
Reality: Firewalls restrict traffic using Access Control Lists (ACLs), but the biggest threats often come from authorized users inside the firewall.

Understanding what needs to be secured is essential for effective cyber security.
