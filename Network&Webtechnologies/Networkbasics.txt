Network Basics

1. Command: ipconfig /all
    - Use this command to view detailed network configuration information.

2. IP Address
    - Every device on a network is uniquely identified by its IP address.
    - Types of IP addresses:
      • IPv4
      • IPv6

3. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - IP addresses are limited resources.
    - Organizations allocate IP addresses to devices temporarily and deallocate them when not needed.
    - This process is managed by a DHCP server.
    - The DHCP server functions similarly to a router.

4. Domain Name
    - A domain name is assigned to an IP address or a group of IP addresses.
    - No two organizations can have the same domain name.

5. Host Name, Subdomain, Domain
    - Structure: hostname.subdomain.domain
    - Example: www.example.com
