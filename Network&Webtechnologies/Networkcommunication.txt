Network & Web Technologies: Key Concepts

1. **IP Address & Network ID**
    - If two IP addresses share the same network ID, they belong to the same network.
    - The **Subnet Mask** separates the network ID from the host ID.

2. **Switches & MAC Addresses**
    - Switches send broadcast messages to all connected devices.
    - **MAC Address**:
      - Uniquely identifies each device on a network.
      - Permanent and also called the physical address.
      - Never changes, unlike IP addresses.
      - Switches use MAC addresses to forward data, not IP addresses.
      - Used by DHCP servers to assign IP addresses when none are available.

3. **Default Gateway**
    - The default gateway is typically a router.
    - Find your default gatewayâ€™s IP address using `ipconfig`.

4. **Routers**
    - Routers connect multiple networks.
    - A router is part of two or more networks, each with its own network ID.

5. **Firewall**
    - Acts as a security barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
    - Controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on organizational policies.
    - Can be hardware-based or software-based.

6. **Wi-Fi & Wireless Access Point (WAP)**
    - **Wi-Fi** stands for Wireless Fidelity.
    - A **Wireless Access Point (WAP)** lets wireless devices connect to a wired network.
    - Modern routers usually have a built-in Access Point.
