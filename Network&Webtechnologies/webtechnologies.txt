Internet: The internet is a network of networks. The World Wide Web (WWW) is just one of many systems that use the internet. Think of the internet like a road: itâ€™s used by private vehicles, public transport, and emergency services. Similarly, the internet supports web, email, communication systems like Skype, and more.

Web: The web is a system for accessing resources across a network using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). A URL is a unique address for every resource on the network.
Example: http://mysparshv2/Pages/Home.aspx

Content Types: Web technologies use static, dynamic, and active content types.

Web Interaction: Interaction on the web happens through HTTP requests and responses.

TCP/IP Layers:
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Link Layer

Web Services: A web service is a system of communication using HTTP, allowing different applications to communicate with each other.

API (Application Programming Interface): An API is an interface between one application and another. Think of it as a remote control with buttons (methods). Just as you use a TV remote to control the TV, you use API methods to interact with another application.
