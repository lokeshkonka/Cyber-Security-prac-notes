THREAT MODELING IN SOFTWARE SECURITY

1. Introduction
---------------
When applications are deployed, they face numerous threats from the Internet. A single security vulnerability can cause severe damage, making it crucial for organizations to design and develop secure applications. Threat modeling, conducted during the design phase of the software development life-cycle, is essential for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.

2. What is Threat Modeling?
---------------------------
Threat modeling is a systematic process of analyzing application design to identify potential security problems. It enables organizations to develop highly secure applications by detecting vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

3. The Threat Modeling Process
-----------------------------
The process involves these key steps:
a) Analyzing the application's Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
b) Team assessment of potential security threats
c) Documentation of identified threats (threat model)
d) Identification of vulnerabilities and counter-measures

4. Real-World Analogy
---------------------
Consider walking home from work:
- Threats: Rain, robbery
- Vulnerabilities: No umbrella, poorly lit streets
- Countermeasures: Carrying an umbrella, choosing well-lit routes
This intuitive process mirrors threat modeling in software development.

5. Security Approaches in Software Development
-------------------------------------------
Two main approaches exist:
a) Security as Afterthought (discouraged)
    - Security considered only during testing
    - Leads to costly redesigns and code rewrites

b) Security Early in SDLC (recommended)
    - "Shift left" approach
    - Incorporates security from design phase
    - Includes threat modeling as key activity

6. Steps in Threat Modeling
--------------------------
1. Identify security objectives
2. Create application overview
3. Decompose application
4. Identify threats
5. Identify vulnerabilities
6. Document security controls and countermeasures

7. Benefits
----------
- Early vulnerability detection
- Reduced development costs
- Better evaluation of security controls
- Clear project oversight
- Minimized security defects pre-development

Note: Further details and practical examples will be covered in the "Learn Threat Modeling with a Use Case" module.
